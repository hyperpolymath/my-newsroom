== Risk Mitigation

[cols="2,1,1,2"]
|===
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation

| Solo compiler delays
| High
| High
| Prototype in Julia first, port later

| SPARK verification too slow
| Medium
| Medium
| Allow proofs to be skipped in dev mode

| AI synthesis unreliable
| Medium
| Low
| Human fallback for `@synth` holes

| BFT consensus fails
| Low
| High
| Extensive testing with adversarial scenarios

| Funding shortfall
| Medium
| High
| Bootstrap with academic grants
|===

== Open Questions

. *Can Dempster-Shafer scale to 100 agents?*
** Test: Benchmark with N=10, 50, 100, 1000
** Fallback: Hierarchical fusion (fuse within domains first)

. *Will news organizations adopt this?*
** Validate: User interviews with journalists/editors
** Pivot: Publish as research contribution if not adopted

. *Is 24 months realistic?*
** Conservative: Add 6-month buffer (30 months)
** Aggressive: Parallelize with larger team

== How to Contribute

See link:CONTRIBUTING.md[CONTRIBUTING.md] for:

* Code style guidelines
* Testing requirements
* Documentation standards
* Review process

Current priority tasks:

. Solo parser implementation
. Julia test coverage
. Documentation improvements

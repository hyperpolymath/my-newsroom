INTERPRETATION

- This license prioritizes human welfare over commercial convenience
- Ambiguities are resolved in favor of protecting affected communities
- Good-faith mistakes trigger remediation, not punishment
- Intentional harm or refusal to remediate may result in legal action

COMPATIBILITY

This license is compatible with:
- MIT License (you may choose MIT instead if preferred)

- GPL 3.0 (copyleft provisions apply to GPL'd derivatives)

This license is INCOMPATIBLE with:
- Proprietary licenses that prohibit modification
- Licenses that disclaim ethical responsibilities

RATIONALE

Software is not ethically neutral. By using this Software, you accept
responsibility for its impacts. We believe in second chances—hence the
remediation-first approach—but not at the expense of vulnerable populations.

If you find these terms unreasonable, please use software under a different
license. If you want to build ethically but these terms are too strict,
contact us to discuss alternatives.

END OF LICENSE

ADDITIONAL NOTES
================================================================================

## Why Dual License?

We offer MIT as the primary license because:
1. Maximum compatibility with existing ecosystems
2. Well-understood by lawyers and corporations
3. No ambiguity about rights and obligations

We offer Palimpsest as an alternative because:
1. Encodes ethical commitments directly in legal terms
2. Provides remediation pathway instead of immediate termination
3. Aligns with research mission (politically autonomous software)

## Which License Should I Choose?

**Choose MIT if:**
- You want maximum legal certainty
- Your organization requires OSI-approved licenses
- You're integrating with MIT/Apache-licensed projects
- You trust social norms over legal enforcement of ethics

**Choose Palimpsest if:**
- You want explicit ethical guardrails
- You're comfortable with newer license models
- You believe software creators have ongoing responsibilities
- You want to signal values alignment in legal terms

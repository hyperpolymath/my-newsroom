# LICENSING FOR AI USE

# If you wish to use this project's code for AI training, you must:
# 1. Contact: legal@my-newsroom.example.com
# 2. Negotiate a commercial license
# 3. Provide attribution in model cards
# 4. Comply with Palimpsest License v0.8 ethical requirements

# EXCEPTIONS (Explicitly Allowed)

# The following are ALLOWED without prior permission:
# - Using project as a library in your application (per MIT License)
# - Reading documentation to learn concepts
# - Analyzing code for security research
# - Citing academic papers in your research
# - Using AI assistants to help contribute to THIS project

# DETECTION & ENFORCEMENT

# We monitor for unauthorized use via:
# - Web server logs (User-Agent analysis)
# - Model card audits (checking for attribution)
# - Derivative work detection (code similarity analysis)

# If we detect unauthorized training use:
# 1. Formal cease-and-desist letter
# 2. Request for model card disclosure
# 3. Potential legal action under copyright/contract law

# ATTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS

# If you have permission to use this code for training, you must:
# 1. Include in model card:
#    "Trained on code from My-newsroom project (MIT + Palimpsest v0.8 License)"
# 2. Link to: https://gitlab.com/Hyperpolymath/My-newsroom
# 3. Preserve copyright notices in any generated code snippets

# FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

# Q: Can I use ChatGPT/Claude to help me contribute code?
# A: Yes! AI assistance for contributions to THIS project is explicitly allowed.

# Q: Can I train my own model on this code?
# A: No, unless you negotiate a commercial license. Training is opt-out by default.

# Q: Can I use this project as a library in my app?
# A: Yes! The MIT license allows this (see LICENSE.txt).

# Q: What about academic research using this code?
# A: Allowed for analysis, citation, and benchmarking. Not allowed for training datasets.

# Q: How do I request permission for AI training?
# A: Email legal@my-newsroom.example.com with your use case and we'll discuss terms.

# RATIONALE

# Why opt-out of AI training?
# 1. Preserve commercial options (potential future funding)
# 2. Ethical concerns about unconsented use of research work
# 3. Alignment with Palimpsest License philosophy (consent-first)
# 4. Control over how epistemic programming concepts are represented in models

# We believe:
# - Developers should control how their code is used for AI training
# - Consent-first is better than opt-out-after-the-fact
# - Commercial AI companies should negotiate licenses, not scrape freely
# - Academic/research use should still be permitted (with attribution)

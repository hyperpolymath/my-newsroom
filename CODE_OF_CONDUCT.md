## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a **harassment-free experience** for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an **open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy** community.

## Our Standards

### ✅ Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

- **Empathy and kindness** toward other people
- **Respect** for differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- **Graceful acceptance** of constructive feedback
- **Taking responsibility** for mistakes and learning from them
- **Focusing on what is best** for the overall community, not just individuals

### Specific to My-newsroom:

- **Epistemic humility**: Acknowledging uncertainty in knowledge claims
- **Good-faith argumentation**: Steelman opponents' positions, don't strawman
- **Credit prior art**: Cite sources, acknowledge inspiration
- **Reproducibility**: Share data, code, and methods openly
- **Accessibility**: Write inclusive documentation, provide alt text, use clear language

---

### ❌ Examples of unacceptable behavior:

- **Disruption**: Sustained derailing of discussions, spamming, or bad-faith participation

### Specific to My-newsroom:

- **Academic dishonesty**: Plagiarism, fabricated data, or uncredited ideas

- **Silencing tactics**: Dismissing marginalized voices as "too emotional" or "not rigorous"
- **Gatekeeping**: "You're not a *real* programmer/journalist/academic unless..."

---

## Enforcement Responsibilities

**Community leaders** (TPCF Perimeter 1 maintainers) are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards. They will take **appropriate and fair corrective action** in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

**Rights:**
- Remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions not aligned with this Code of Conduct
- Temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for behaviors they deem inappropriate

**Obligations:**
- Communicate reasons for moderation decisions
- Allow appeals (see Enforcement Process below)
- Recuse themselves from decisions where they have conflicts of interest

---

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within **all community spaces**, including:

- GitLab repositories (issues, merge requests, discussions)
- Email lists and private correspondence
- Social media (when representing the project)
- Conferences, meetups, and online events
- One-on-one interactions between community members

It also applies when an individual is **officially representing the community** in public spaces (e.g., speaking at a conference with project affiliation).

---

## Reporting

### How to Report

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior:

1. **Immediate safety concerns**: Contact local law enforcement
2. **Code of Conduct violations**: Email conduct@[project-domain]
3. **Confidential concerns**: Email specific maintainers (see MAINTAINERS.md)

### What to Include

```markdown
## Incident Summary
Brief description (1-2 sentences)

## Details
- Who: Individuals involved (names, handles, roles)
- What: Specific behaviors or statements
- When: Date and time (include timezone)
- Where: Platform (GitLab issue #123, email thread, conference, etc.)
- Context: Relevant background or prior interactions

## Evidence
- Links to public comments/issues
- Screenshots (redact private info)
- Email headers (if relevant)
- Witness names (if willing to be contacted)

## Impact
How this affected you or the community

## Desired Outcome
- [ ] Warning to offender
- [ ] Temporary ban
- [ ] Permanent ban
- [ ] Other: ___________
```

### Confidentiality

All reports will be kept **confidential** except:
- When legally required to disclose
- When reporter explicitly requests public handling
- When necessary to protect others from imminent harm

We will **not** publicly name reporters without their consent.

---

## Enforcement Process

### 1. Graduated Response (TPCF-Aligned)

We use a **remediation-first** approach (aligned with Palimpsest License):

| Level | Violation | Response | Duration |
|-------|-----------|----------|----------|
| **Advice** | Minor, first-time, good-faith mistake | Private message explaining issue | N/A |
| **Warning** | Repeated minor or single moderate violation | Formal written warning | 30 days probation |
| **Temporary Ban** | Serious violation or pattern of behavior | Ban from all community spaces | 30-90 days |
| **Permanent Ban** | Severe violation or refusal to remediate | Permanent expulsion from community | Permanent |

**Key Principle:** Focus on **behavior change**, not punishment. We assume good faith unless proven otherwise.

### 2. Investigation Timeline

1. **Acknowledgment**: Within 72 hours
2. **Initial assessment**: Within 7 days
3. **Decision**: Within 14 days
4. **Appeal** (if requested): Within 14 days of decision

### 3. Appeal Process

If you disagree with an enforcement decision:

1. Email conduct-appeals@[project-domain] within **14 days**
2. Explain why you believe the decision was incorrect
3. Provide new evidence or context not previously considered
4. A different maintainer (not involved in original decision) will review

**Appeal outcomes:**
- Overturn decision (violation didn't occur)
- Reduce severity (e.g., temp ban → warning)
- Uphold decision (no change)
- Increase severity (if new evidence warrants)

---

## Enforcement Examples

### Example 1: Microaggression (Advice Level)

**Scenario:** Contributor says "This is so simple, even a journalist could do it" in code review.

**Response:**
> "Hey, please be mindful of language that might unintentionally demean groups. We have journalists contributing to this project, and comments like 'even a journalist could do it' can come across as dismissive. I know you didn't mean it that way, but let's keep feedback focused on code quality, not stereotypes. Thanks!"

**Outcome:** No formal action, educational moment

---

### Example 2: Repeated Dismissive Behavior (Warning Level)

**Scenario:** Contributor repeatedly dismisses bug reports from Windows users with "Just use Linux" without investigating.

**Response:**
> "This is your second warning about dismissing platform-specific issues. Our project aims to be cross-platform, and users on all OSes deserve respect. We need you to either:
> 1. Help debug Windows issues, or
> 2. Politely decline and let others handle them
>
> Continued dismissive behavior will result in a temporary ban. You have 30 days probation during which we'll be monitoring your interactions."

**Outcome:** Formal warning + 30-day probation

---

### Example 3: Harassment (Temporary Ban)

**Scenario:** Contributor sends unsolicited sexual messages to another contributor.

**Response:**
> "Your behavior (sending unsolicited sexual messages) is a serious violation of our Code of Conduct. You are banned from all community spaces for 90 days, effective immediately.
>
> If you wish to return after the ban:
> 1. Acknowledge the harm caused
> 2. Apologize sincerely to the affected party (if they consent to contact)
> 3. Demonstrate understanding of why this was inappropriate
>
> You may appeal this decision within 14 days to conduct-appeals@[project-domain]."

**Outcome:** 90-day ban with reinstatement conditions

---

### Example 4: Doxxing (Permanent Ban)

**Scenario:** Contributor publishes another member's home address and phone number after a heated disagreement.

**Response:**
> "Publishing private information (doxxing) is a severe violation that puts people at risk. You are permanently banned from all community spaces, effective immediately, with no possibility of reinstatement.
>
> We have reported this incident to platform administrators and may report to law enforcement if the affected party chooses to pursue legal action."

**Outcome:** Permanent ban, possible legal action

---

## Attribution

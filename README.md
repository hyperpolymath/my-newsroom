## 🎯 What is My-newsroom?

**My-newsroom** is a research project exploring **epistemic programming languages** and **neurosymbolic AI** for journalism. It demonstrates how formal uncertainty quantification (Dempster-Shafer theory) and multi-agent systems can improve journalistic verification, fact-checking, and source credibility assessment.

### Core Innovation

The **My Language** family provides graduated trust semantics across four dialects:

1. **Me** - Epistemic types with belief states and probabilistic reasoning
2. **Solo** - Systems programming with affine types and arena allocation
3. **Duet** - Human-AI co-programming with formal verification
4. **Ensemble** - Multi-agent orchestration with belief fusion

Together, these enable type-safe reasoning about uncertainty, automated verification of journalistic claims, and politically autonomous software resistant to vendor lock-in.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11+** (for prototyping)
- **Rust 1.75+** (for Solo dialect compiler)
- **Node.js 20+** (for Me dialect playground)
- **Ada 2022** (optional, for formal verification)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://gitlab.com/Hyperpolymath/My-newsroom.git
cd My-newsroom

# Install dependencies (Python prototype)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run examples
python examples/dempster_shafer_basic.py
```

### First Example: Belief Fusion

```my
# Me dialect: Epistemic types
belief source_a: Float where confidence(0.85);
belief source_b: Float where confidence(0.60);

# Fuse beliefs using Dempster-Shafer
result := fuse(source_a, source_b, rule=Dempster);
assert result.confidence >= 0.85;
```

```python
# Python prototype (current implementation)
from mynewsroom.dempster_shafer import BeliefMass, fuse_beliefs

# Define belief masses over frame Θ = {true, false}
m1 = BeliefMass({"true": 0.7, "false": 0.1, "Θ": 0.2})
m2 = BeliefMass({"true": 0.5, "false": 0.3, "Θ": 0.2})

# Combine using Dempster's rule
result = fuse_beliefs(m1, m2, method="dempster")
print(result)  # BeliefMass({"true": 0.877, "false": 0.081, "Θ": 0.041})
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Newroom Demonstration Project

The flagship demonstration is a **multi-agent newsroom** that verifies journalistic claims using distributed belief fusion:

```ensemble
comptime orchestrate NewsVerificationRing {
    agents: [
        ReporterAgent(domain: "politics"),
        ReporterAgent(domain: "science"),
        FactCheckerAgent(sources: [Snopes, FactCheck]),
        SourceEvaluatorAgent(credibility_db: "databases/sources.json"),
        EditorAgent(threshold: 0.85),
    ],
    topology: Ring,
    fusion: DempsterShafer,
    consensus: Threshold(0.85),
}
```

**Key Features:**
- 50-100 specialized agents (reporters, fact-checkers, editors)
- Dempster-Shafer belief fusion for evidence combination
- Formal uncertainty propagation (no false certainty)
- Explainable AI (trace belief updates through agent interactions)
- Offline-first (works air-gapped, no cloud dependencies)

### Technology Stack
